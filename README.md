## 🧠 Building this project taught me how to:
* Create server routes to POST and GET data to and from the MongoDB database
* Integrate OpenAI's DALL-E API to generate images from text through the use of AI
* Use React Router to handle client-side page routing
* Style React components with Tailwind CSS
