# üñºÔ∏è AI Image Generator

Developed a full-stack MERN applicaion where users can generate images with AI and share them with the community for others to interact with.

## üß† Building this project taught me how to:
* Create server routes to Post and Get data to and from MongoDB
* Integrate OpenAI's DALL-E API to generate images from text through AI
* Use React Router to handle client side page routing
* Style React components using Tailwind CSS
